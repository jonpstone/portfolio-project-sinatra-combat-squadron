A web app for MMO flight sim communities who wish to keep track of group members and their aircraft for games like 'IL2', 'DCS' as well as arcade oriented experiences like 'World of Warplanes' and 'War Thunder'. This would include a squadron personnel roster and an equipment inventory for each pilot. There are three distinct models: Pilots[read: users], Planes and Weapons. A Pilot has many planes and a plane has many weapons.
