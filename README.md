# COMBAT SQUADRON

## DESCRIPTION

A Sinatra web app for Mass Multiplayer Online (MMO) flight simulator communities to keep track of their teamâ€™s progress and stats. It allows for the creation of *pilots*(read: users), *planes* and *weapons* for the aforementioned *planes*. *Pilots* can create *planes* and *weapons*, but cannot delete other *pilots* or *planes* that they haven't signed up to fly. However any *pilot* can delete any *weapon*. I think this is a project that I would like to expand on in the future and perhaps include a scraping ability so as to retrieve data from player server pages as well as migrating this code to Rails.
